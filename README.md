# SwinSF: Image Reconstruction from Spatial-Temporal Spike Streams

Welcome to the **SwinSF** project! This repository contains the implementation of the **Swin Spikeformer (SwinSF)** model, as described in the paper ["Image Reconstruction from Spatial-Temporal Spike Streams"](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15708). SwinSF is designed to reconstruct high-quality images from spike streams generated by spike cameras, which are particularly useful for high-speed imaging where motion blur is a challenge.
