## 👋 Abstract
>  The spike camera, with its high temporal resolution, low latency, and high dynamic range, addresses high-speed imaging challenges like motion blur. It captures photons at each pixel independently, creating binary spike streams rich in temporal information but challenging for image reconstruction. Current algorithms, both traditional and deep learning-based, still need to be improved in the utilization of the rich temporal detail and the restoration of the details of the reconstructed image. To overcome this, we introduce Swin Spikeformer (SwinSF), a novel model for dynamic scene reconstruction from spike streams. SwinSF is composed of Spike Feature Extraction, Spatial-Temporal Feature Extraction, and Final Reconstruction Module. It combines shifted window self-attention and proposed temporal spike attention, ensuring a comprehensive feature extraction that encapsulates both spatial and temporal dynamics, leading to a more robust and accurate reconstruction of spike streams. Furthermore, we build a new synthesized dataset for spike image reconstruction which matches the resolution of the latest spike camera, ensuring its relevance and applicability to the latest developments in spike camera imaging. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed network SwinSF sets a new benchmark, achieving state-of-the-art performance across a series of datasets, including both real-world and synthesized data across various resolutions.


Welcome to the **SwinSF** project! This repository contains the implementation of the **Swin Spikeformer (SwinSF)** model, as described in the paper ["SwinSF: Image Reconstruction from Spatial-Temporal Spike Streams"](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15708). SwinSF is designed to reconstruct high-quality images from spike streams generated by spike cameras, which are particularly useful for high-speed imaging where motion blur is a challenge.

## 💪 Getting Started

### 🌏 Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- Python 3.6.13
- PyTorch 1.10.0+cu113
- Other dependencies as listed in `requirements.txt`

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### 📖 Datasets

To begin with the SwinSF project, you will need to download the datasets from [Baidu Wangpan](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1N6tMru-fn5iJ0oyygHg1hQ?pwd=cps6) to the datasets directory.

- **spike-reds**: A simulated dataset with ground truth, 250x400 pixels, from the paper [Spk2ImgNet: Learning to Reconstruct Dynamic Scene from Continuous Spike Stream](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Zhao_Spk2ImgNet_Learning_To_Reconstruct_Dynamic_Scene_From_Continuous_Spike_Stream_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf).
- **spike-X4K**: A simulated dataset created for this project, with ground truth, 1000x1000 pixels.
- **spike-classA**: A dataset captured by a spike camera from the Peking University team, 250x400 pixels, without ground truth.

Please note that the reds and classA datasets are not created by our team, so please contact the original authors to download them.

## 💻 Training

To train the SwinSF model on the reds dataset, use the following command:
```bash
python train.py --data_mode 250 --dataset_path ./datasets/spike_reds --device cuda:0
```
For the X4K dataset, use:
```bash
python train.py --data_mode 1000 --dataset_path ./datasets/spike_x4k --device cuda:0
```
To train using multiple GPUs, add the --device_ids 01 option (make sure the first device in device_ids matches the --device setting). For CPU training, simply use --device cpu.

Training weights will be automatically saved to the checkpoint directory.

## 📊 Testing

To test the model and save the reconstructed images for the reds dataset, use:
```bash
python test.py --data_mode 250 --dataset_path ./datasets/spike_reds --device cuda:0 --load_model /path/to/training/parameters --save_image True --save_path /path/to/save/images
```
For the X4K dataset:
```bash
python test.py --data_mode 1000 --dataset_path ./datasets/spike_x4k --device cuda:0 --load_model /path/to/training/parameters --save_image True --save_path /path/to/save/images
```
And for the classA dataset:
```bash
python test.py --data_mode 250 --dataset_path ./datasets/classA --device cuda:0 --load_model /path/to/training/parameters --save_image True --save_path /path/to/save/images
```

## 🌅 Model Weights
